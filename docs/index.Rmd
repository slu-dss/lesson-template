# Overview

---
# What is a lesson?

Each lesson for SLU DSS is a part of a seminar, which is a group of lessons organized around a core theme.

--

We currently have six seminars that we have developed content for:

1. Getting Started with `R`

2. Data Wrangling in `R`

3. Plots and Figures in `R`

4. Building Linear Models in `R`

5. Mapping Data in `R`

6. Functions and Packages in `R`

--

Seminars typically have four lessons. Each lesson is designed to be delivered in an hour-long session.

# How are lessons organized?

Each lesson has a corresponding GitHub repository. We are currently revising each lesson so that it contains the following key items:

* A **`README.md`** file that describes the lesson's objectives, provides a `usethis` download link, and provides links to additional resources.

* A Creative Commons [**BY-SA 4.0 license**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

* An **R project** (`.Rproj`) file that participants can use to easily access lesson materials.

* A **`.gitignore`** file

* A **`DESCRIPTION`** file that provides systematically organized metadata, and allows us to test repositories using **continuous integration** tools to ensure our code stays up-to-date

    * Settings **`.yml`** files for Travis-CI (for testing code on macOS/linux) and Appveyor (for testing code on Windows)

# How are lessons organized?

Each lesson has a corresponding GitHub repository. We are currently revising each lesson so that it contains the following key items:

* Any **data** that is required, *though we prioritize using data available in packages.*

* An **R notebook** written in the style of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) that contains narrative text that explains the particulars of a topic, provides example code, and provides empty code blocks for participants to practice in.

   * A complete version of the R notebook that contains all code, including the solutions to the empty areas provided for participant practice.

* A set of **slides** (like these!) made with `xaringan` that give a high level overview of the lesson.

* A **challenge** for participants to complete after the lesson if they want to practice, and a corresponding set of replication code for participants to check their own work.

---

# How are lessons organized?

Each lesson has a corresponding GitHub repository. We are currently revising each lesson so that it contains the following key items:

* A set of **reference** materials that help participants get set-up and highlight key terms, concepts, and packages

* A **`.github/`** directory with instructions for contributing to the lesson

* A **`CONTRIBUTORS.md`** file acknowledging everyone who has contributed to the lesson

# How can I help?

So glad that you asked! We are looking for "lesson maintainers" to help us with a variety of tasks:

1. Converting our current lessons into this lesson format.

2. Adding overview slides like these.

3. Updating code so that it follows the most state-of-the-art standards (e.g. `tidyverse`)

4. Creating the "complete" versions of notebooks that contain solutions.

5. Creating challenges for students to test their knowledge after each lesson.

--

No expertise with the lesson is necessary - we're happy to help you grow your skills with `R`, the `tidyverse`, and Git/GitHub!

# Getting Started

---

# What You'll Need

To successfully contribute as a lesson maintainer, you'll need the following software tools installed on your computer:

1. `R` ([download](https://www.r-project.org))

2. RStudio ([download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download))

3. Git ([download](https://git-scm.com))

It isn't necessary, but a flexible text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io) is also very useful for updating particular parts of lessons.

---

# What You'll Need

You'll also need a few R packages that you can download and install from CRAN:

1. [`devtools`](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools)

2. [`knitr`](https://yihui.name/knitr/)

3. [`RMarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com)

4. the [`tidyverse`](http://tidyverse.org)

--

To install a package from CRAN, type the following into your console:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

---

# What You *Might* Need

If you are contributing to the development of slides for lessons, you'll need the [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package.

--

To install a package from GitHub using `devtools`, type the following into your console:

```r
devtools::install_github("yihui/xaringan")
```

--

If you are contributing to our GIS seminar's lessons, you'll need the [`sf`](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) package from CRAN and the [development version of `ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/) from GitHub.

# More Details, Please!

We are building a [wiki](https://github.com/slu-dss/lesson-template/wiki) with additional details to help guide lesson maintainers.
