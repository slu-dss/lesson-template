## Introduction
This is a sample notebook that illustrates the notebook template that should be used for SLU DSS lesson challenges. We've provided a little bit of structure, including a short example of the literate programming style, to help get you started!

## Tasks

1. Load the tabular data set `stlSmoking.csv` into your enviornment
2. Make a list of the included variables using `dplyr`
3. Calculate descriptive statistics for the included variables using `skmir`
4. Create a histogram using `ggplot2`

## Load Dependencies
The following code loads the package dependencies.

```{r package-load}

```

We now have the packages needed for our analyses.
